Scenario: Disk Usage Issue on a Server

Question: A server is running out of disk space on the / partition. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?

Answer:

	1.	Check Disk Usage:
Run df -h to see which partitions are consuming disk space.

df -h

	2.	Find Large Files:
Use du to locate large files and directories consuming space.

du -sh /* | sort -rh | head -10


	3.	Check Logs:
The /var/log directory often contains large logs. Investigate any unusually large log files.

du -sh /var/log/*


	4.	Clear Unnecessary Files:
	•	Clean package caches:

sudo apt-get clean  # for Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum clean all  # for CentOS/RHEL


	•	Delete unnecessary log files or compress old logs.
	•	Remove orphaned packages and unnecessary dependencies.

Explanation: The key is identifying large files or directories consuming space and cleaning unnecessary data. Logs, cache files, and backup files are common culprits.
